This github repository is the code for a website I built, sacnutritional.org, as a component of my senior project. My partner and I aim to promote healthy, affordable ways of cooking by hosting cooking tutorials and live classes.

Under cooking plan, you will see mostly html/css/javascript code. The website is primarily built from bootstrap and is used for the frontend of our program, as well as the sign up page. When a user signs up for a class, data is sent over the wire to API Gateway which triggers our lambda, SignUp. SignUp deserializes the input into a HashMap which would latter be broken down into AttributeValues and placed into DynamoDB. Moreover, AWS Pinpoint will also send a text message notifying the user that their order is confirmed. They are also subscribed to our AWS SNS subscription as well. 

In order to confront the coldstart problem, I have also attatched Cloudwatch events as a Lambda trigger. Cloudwatch events will ping SignUp Lambda every 5 minutes, ensuring that my code is always hot and ready to go. The SignUp Lambda also checks if the input is null, indicating that the call was simply a hearbeat check and not an actual call to the lambda. As a result, there will be no weird 10 sec delays in my lambda call.
